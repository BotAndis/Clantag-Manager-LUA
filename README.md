# Clantag-Manager-LUA
### **What is the clantag manager lua?**
With the clantag manager lua, you are able to choose from 8 different clan tags, including: Gamesense, fanta, onetap, millionware, aimware, and [VALVá´±], and nicel's animated numbers tag. The tags are all enabled or disabled in the lua settings tab.

I plan on adding more things to this in the future, and all criticism or suggestions for the LUA are welcome.
