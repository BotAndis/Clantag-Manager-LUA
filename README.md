# Clantag-Manager-LUA
### **What is the clantag manager lua?**
With the clantag manager lua, you are able to choose from 8 different clan tags, including: Gamesense, fanta, onetap, millionware, aimware, [VALVá´±], nicel's animated numbers tag, custom clantag, and custom clantags bound to keys. The tags are all enabled or disabled in the lua settings tab.

#### The clock clantag will be coming in the next interium update, as Nicel will be adding a new function which makes the tag possible.

I plan to keep on adding more things to this in the future, and all criticism or suggestions for the LUA are welcome.
