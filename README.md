# Clantag-Manager-LUA
### **What is the clantag manager lua?**
With the clantag manager lua, you are able to choose from 8 different clan tags, including: Gamesense, fanta, onetap, millionware, aimware, animated clock clantag (24 or 12 hour options), custom clantag, custom animated tag, and custom clantags bound to keys. The tags are all enabled or disabled in the lua settings tab.

In this update, I added a better tag enabling system, removed the valve and animated numbers tag, and added a custom animated tag feature

I plan on adding more things to this in the future, and all criticism or suggestions for the LUA are welcome.
